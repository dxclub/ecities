# DxClub Ecities Challenge
Download the **ecities.csv** file and the **ecities.jpg** image. Open the CSV file, and look for a person of interest that is connected to the **city on the image** and the **world of cybersecurity**. PLEASE do not look at the data row by row, you will spend a bit of time doing so! Hope you enjoy this fun and simple challenge! Good luck!

**NOTE:** Do not look at the data_generator.py until after completing the challenge (unless stuck), the person of interest is listed on the comments in the code!
